## Description
This project was created under the context of a commission from a school who needed a good standing system. This is reflected in the name, 
which is an abbreviated version of Cactus Island (the school name) Good Standing Application. 
## Functions
The program is able to perform the following functions:
 - Create a student profile and save information to it, such as their name and student ID, their good standing points or the rewards they have unlocked at their
current standing.
 - Read a student profile and return the data associated with it
 - Edit a student profile
 - Print a brief overview of each student entered into the system
 - Save the data to a excel file so that information can remain between program restarts
 - Load the data from the excel spreadsheet to be able to be edited in the program
## Quick overview
